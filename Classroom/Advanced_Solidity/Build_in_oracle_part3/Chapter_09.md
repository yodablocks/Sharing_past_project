# Chapter 9: Using SafeMath

Now let's take some time to discuss security in your contract.

Doing something like `computedEthPrice +=  requestIdToResponse[_id][f].ethPrice;` works well for a large number of oracles but the thing is that `computedEthPrice` can overflow for a very large number of oracles.

First, let's look into what's an overflow.

Suppose you define an `uint8` variable like this:

```Solidity
uint8 exampleOverflow = 255;
```

Because the `exampleOverflow` variable can only have 8 bits, the largest number you can store is `255` (`2^8 -1` or `11111111`).

Now, if you execute the following line of code:

```Solidity
exampleOverflow++;
```

Then, the `exampleOverflow` variable will equal `0`, even if you just increased it. Give it a try if you want to.

Similarly, if you subtract `1` from a `uint8` variable whose value is 0, the result will equal `255`. This is called an **underflow**.

Now, the contract is indeed using `uint`, making it highly improbable that'll overflow, but it's a good practice to protect it contract against unexpected behavior.


## The SafeMath Library

For such situations, OpenZepppelin created the `SafeMath` library. Let's look at the code:

```Solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

/**
 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow
 * checks.
 *
 * Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result
 * in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an
 * error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.
 * `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an
 * operation overflows.
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.

library SafeMath {
    /**
     * @dev Returns the addition of two unsigned integers, reverting on
     * overflow.
     *
     * Counterpart to Solidity's `+` operator.
     *
     * Requirements:
     * - Addition cannot overflow.
     */
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        require(c >= a, "SafeMath: addition overflow");

        return c;
    }

```

Similarly to what you did in the previous chapters with `Roles`, first you'll have to add the following line of code:

```Solidity
using SafeMath for uint256;
```

Then, you can use SafeMath's functions- `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `div`:

```Solidity
using SafeMath for uint256;
// now we can use these methods on any uint256
uint256 test = 4;
test = test.div(2); // test now equals 2
test = test.add(5); // test now equals 7
```

## Put It to the Test

We've already imported from the OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` library for you.

1. First, let's tell your contract to use `SafeMath` for `uint256`. Add the `using SafeMath for uint256;` declaration.
2. Replace `computedEthPrice +=  requestIdToResponse[_id][f].ethPrice;` with a `SafeMath` method.
3. Replace `computedEthPrice = computedEthPrice / numResponses;` with a SafeMath method.
