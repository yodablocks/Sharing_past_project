# Chapter 2: Getting Started with Truffle

Now that we've installed **Truffle**, it's time to initialize our new project by running `truffle init`. All it is doing is to create a set of folders and config files with the following structure:

```
├── contracts
    ├── Migrations.sol
├── migrations
    ├── 1_initial_migration.js
└── test
truffle-config.js
truffle.js
```

Contracts, migrations, tests... this is pretty complicate

Don't worry, learning to use **Truffle** won't eat your brains. This chapter will walk you through **Truffle**'s default project structure, and once you know how to use **Truffle**, deploying smart contracts will be a breeze.
