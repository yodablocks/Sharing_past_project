In this example, the **disassemble_bytecode** function takes a bytecode string as input and returns a list of disassembled instructions. It uses a while loop to iterate over the bytecode, checking the opcode of each instruction and adding the corresponding mnemonic to the instructions list.

Note that this is a simplified example and only covers a subset of the Ethereum EVM opcodes. You can extend it to support more opcodes and add additional functionality as per your requirements.

---------------------

To extend the Ethereum EVM bytecode disassembler to support more opcodes, you can add additional elif conditions to handle the new opcodes.

In this example, I've added support for four additional opcodes: CALLDATALOAD, CALLDATASIZE, CALLDATACOPY, and SLOAD. You can add more opcodes following the same pattern by appending elif conditions and updating the index accordingly.

Remember to consult the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper" rel="nofollow">Ethereum Yellow Paper</a> or other EVM documentation to ensure that you're using the correct opcodes and handling them appropriately in your disassembler.
