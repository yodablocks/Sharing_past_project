In this example, the disassemble_bytecode function takes a bytecode string as input and returns a list of disassembled instructions. It uses a while loop to iterate over the bytecode, checking the opcode of each instruction and adding the corresponding mnemonic to the instructions list.

Note that this is a simplified example and only covers a subset of the Ethereum EVM opcodes. You can extend it to support more opcodes and add additional functionality as per your requirements.
